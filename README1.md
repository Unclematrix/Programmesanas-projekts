# Rainbows

A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light in water droplets, resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun.

Rainbows are made up of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors are often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV. Each color is a result of light being refracted at different angles.

Rainbows have been a part of human culture and mythology for centuries, often symbolizing hope, promise, and beauty. They are a reminder of the natural wonders that can be found in our world.
